        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a second-year gamedev student @ <b>Rochester Institute of Technology.</b>
        I became interested in game development off the ROBLOX platform when I was a kid,
        where I played with Lua for the better part of a decade. Over time, I grew from a 
        script kiddie pasting off tutorials to a semi-professional earning over $5,000 off side commissions 
        in a year at my peak in 2023. I think this taste of success probably pushed me off the path of
        having a respectable SWE degree to pursuing a degree in game development and getting auto-rejected by HR.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for what I want to get out of RIT, I am to build a proficient skill-set oriented around game development, as well as competence in adjacent fields -- right now, I'm focused on mastering C# for gameplay and tooling architecture, as well as JavaScript for familiarity with web-development tools.
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I am learning pickleball, and have been building a personal cookbook for one-pot rice cooker recipes from chicken rice to beef bowls. 
            I follow Counter-Strike 2 e-sports closely, and am a big supporter of Team Liquid. I mostly listen to shoegaze, DnB, and j-indie music; would highly recommend Wisp, Aphex Twin, and Uchuu Nekoko.
        </p>
